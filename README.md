Simple SIEM with Elasticsearch 
 This project sets up a simple Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the      
 Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana). It's a starting point for building a more comprehensive
 SIEM solution.                                                                                   

 ## Components                                                                                    
 **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that stores and indexes    
 the security data. 
 **Kibana**: A web-based user interface for visualizing and analyzing the data in Elasticsearch.
 ## Getting Started                                                                                   
 To get started, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
        1. Clone this repository.                                                      
        2. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the Elasticsearch and Kibana containers.
        3.  Access Kibana at `http://localhost:5601` in your web browser.
